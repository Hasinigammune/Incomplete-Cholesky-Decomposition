# Incomplete-Cholesky-Decomposition

An incomplete Cholesky factorization of a Symmetric Positive definite matrix is a sparse approximation
of the Cholesky factorization. 

We implemented the incomplete Cholesky decomposition from scratch using R and Rcpp, without using the mainstream libraries and compared the results with those obtained through the mainstream libraries.
