# Incomplete-Cholesky-Decomposition

An incomplete Cholesky factorization of a Symmetric Positive definite matrix is a sparse approximation
of the Cholesky factorization. 

We implemented the incomplete Cholesky decomposition in scratch without using the main stream libraries and compared the results with that obtained through the main stream libraries.
